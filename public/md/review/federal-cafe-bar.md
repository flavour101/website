Sat, unassumingly at the bottom of High Street, Federal Cafe & Bar is surrounded by tables and chairs for passers-by to take a seat and grab a quick coffee or some lunch in the sunshine.

Once you escape the narrow pathway and enter inside however, a ripple of warmth washes over you. The chatter and clinking of a cafe atmosphere enters your bubble and all walls come down as one of the staff members approaches and cheerily says "Hello!".

This is one of the wonderful, consistent aspects of Federal, that I believe makes it one of the finest establishments in Manchester: You feel welcome. As if this was friend's home that they've let you into and whilst they've gone to handle something in the kitchen, you're left to settle yourself in their living room; or in the case of Federal, their inside seating area.

The seating area in Federal is cramped, high-ceilinged, and has a couple of large tables that can have multiple parties sat at. The walls are characterful as plants grow from hanging baskets and bookshelves make host to bags of coffee, confectionary and guides to northern coffee shops.  
The only open space on the walls in fact, are the windows. Huge panes of glass with the Federal logo decorated on them allow customers inside to gaze out into the hustle and bustle of the passing city life, safe knowing that they are enjoying a peaceful cup of coffee.

The food is cooked almost entirely in-house. Ordering from the bar near the entrance, one can see past the chatty till staff and baristas into a small kitchen tucked into the corner of the room. It may be confined, but the dishes that come out of that kitchen are excellent.  
Well-thoughtout concoctions; beautifully presented with a delicate balance of flavours. Each dish that I've indulged in, at Federal, has consistently maintained a high level of quality and has always enticed me back for more, eager to find a flaw or, more likely, another fantastic meal.

The coffee, just like the food, is also excellent. A well-balanced flavour that is the result of a coffee shot that has been pulled very well and milk that has been texturised just right.

Federal don't only do food inside, I should note. They do offer the option of taking away food and drink, if you so wish. I've taken this opportunity up many times, often delighting in purchasing a slice of "Emily's Banana Bread" served with a small pot of marscapone (Emily, I learned, is the owner's wife!), or an Anzac cookie if I'm in a rush.  

With the menu, the attentive, friendly staff as well as the Antipodean flourishes, Federal Cafe & Bar is a cafe that holds a special place in my heart.
