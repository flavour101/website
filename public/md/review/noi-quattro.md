Cosied away at the top of the High Street in Manchester, is Noi Quattro. An Italian restaurant owned and run by four Italians, the restaurant claims their goal is “to bring the tradition and atmosphere of an authentic Italian pizzeria to Manchester”.

Noi Quattro sits on the ground floor of a small, recently built apartment block. Floor to ceiling, slightly tinted windows reveal a large open-plan restaurant with wooden-topped tables and simplistic, black metal chairs.  
Opening the door, one is faced with a small bar and a few smiling faces surrounding it. 

A waitress welcomes and guides me to the restaurant floor where I’m provided with a few tables to choose to sit at.

The restaurant floor is a large, open-plan room with tables neatly organised into rows and columns. Some shelving units split the room in two, with one side holding some larger tables looking out of the east windows, and the other side holding some smaller tables facing the west windows and the kitchen.

A jug of water and a menu is silently brought to the table whilst I'm getting settled. It's a nice touch and it's something I've found that occurs in restaurants that clearly care about what they're doing: There's no need to ask for water and a menu, you're already being taken care of.

On initial review the single-paged, double-sided menu is somewhat confusing, with different menu sections titled with Italian titles and no clear way of understanding what were Starters and what were Mains. However, it can be quickly deduced that one side is for Starters and the other for Pizza.

Emblazoned of the left of the Starters is the term “Cuoppi”.

> _“Cuoppo” is a cone-shaped paper that holds a mixture of delicacies…all cut and fried in a light and easily digestible batter._
> _Cuoppo is a masterpiece of Italian street food._
> _It’s made to be enjoyed while walking through the alleys of the city, passing balconies festooned with washing, or simply while waiting to order a pizza”_

Cuoppo Misto was my choice.

Wrapped in brown, greaseproof paper the Cuoppo spill out onto the plate in all different shapes and sizes accompanied with a large dough ball on a bed of rocket leaves and drop of tomato-based Italian sauce on the top, and 2 small paper cups of ketchup and mayonnaise.

Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, the Cuoppo vary in shape, size and ingredients but all coated in the same batter. Beautifully cooked, the cheese is warm and stretchy, the vegetables are perfectly crispy and the potato melts in your mouth; However the flavour is somewhat lacking as they taste bland with only the cheese giving any real character. The sauces are definitely needed to bring out any flavour in the dish however the presentation of the sauces leaves a lot to be desired as the paper cups look like those that you find in a McDonald’s and not something I’d expect a authentic restaurant to serve.

The pièce de résistance of the dish though is the dough ball on the bed of rocket. The dough is soft and warm, the drop of sauce on the top brings forward wonderful rich, yet delicate flavours and the rocket finishes it with a contrasting texture and a peppered flavour that makes your mouth warm and salivate.

Offering "Rosse" and "Bianche" pizzas (ones with and without a tomato-base, respectively), Noi Quattro offers a wide range of pizzas made from fine ingredients.  
I was lucky enough to have a very pleasant waiter, named Joe, offer me and "off the menu" suggestion:

A bianche pizza topped with ham, potatoes, caramelized onions and a smoked cheese that I believe he said was “Scamorza” (a type of Italian cheese).

The pizza is exquisite. The dough is soft but not chewy, the toppings are cooked but not charred and a single pizza will happily fill a hungry young man like myself.  
Their dough, they claim, is “slowly fermented which makes it really easy to digest” and it's very clear they are speaking the truth.

A range of desserts is on offer, to which I opt for the Delizia Al Limone. A sponge cake, delicately covered in a smooth lemon custard and topped with whipped cream.  
It is a fantastic way to end a meal and the sweet lemon flavours completely balance out the previous, carb-heavy courses.

With super-friendly staff who are eager to share their vision of what their restaurant can be, I shall be returning to Noi Quattro again, eager to try more.
