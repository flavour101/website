# Recipe - Macaroni Cheese (Harm's Mother's Recipe)

This recipe enough to fill large, _shallow_ serving dish (around an 3cm deep). Which is suitable to serve 3-4 people.

If you have a deeper serving dish (around 4-5 cm deep), then multiply the amount of each ingredient, except the breadcrumbs, by **1.5** (I know this because I have deep serving dishes and have to do this. However, this blog post details the _true_, _original_ recipe).

It'll take you about 30 minutes to make.

Also note: This recipe is in Imperial units because it's my mother's and she works in Imperial units.  
I have provided approximate Metric units in brackets.

Final note: I have added the method for making the Mornay sauce using a pan at the bottom.  
I make it in the microwave (and a lot of the time, so does my mum) because it's quicker, easier, and you're less likely to fuck it up. However, if you get it right, the pan made version will make a better, smoother Mornay sauce.

## Equipment

- A serving dish

- A large saucepan with a lid

- A large measuring jug  
(or similar microwavable jug/bowl, preferably one that can hold around 2 pints. I use a 2 pint Pyrex one)

- A grater

- 5 bowls  
(I tend to prepare/weigh my ingredients before starting. These bowls are for putting the macaroni, flour, butter, cheese and breadcrumbs in)

- A set of scales

- A Bread knife

- A cutting board

- A hand balloon whisk  
(No substitute. Do not use a spatula, spoontula or spoon else the sauce will be lumpy!)

- A silicone spoontula  
(A spatula will suffice if you don't have one)

- Cling film

## Ingredients

- 8oz (~227g) of macaroni

- 1pt (~570ml) of milk  
(I use semi-skimmed)

- 2oz (~57g) of butter  
(I'm using salted butter. You can use margarine but I wouldn't recommend)

- 2oz (~57g) of plain flour

- Approximately 2 large handfuls of grated cheese  
(I use a mix of Mature Cheddar and Red Leicester however any relatively hard cheese (ones that you can grate) will be suitable)

- 3 slices worth of breadcrumbs  
(Cut the crusts off the slices of bread and then grate the bread to get breadcrumbs. Brown bread tastes best)

- Salt & pepper

## Method

1. Cook the macaroni in the large saucepan of boiling salted water for about 10 minutes; drain well, cover and set aside.

2. _Whilst the macaroni is cooking, make the Mornay sauce. Check on the macaroni periodically:_

3. Place the butter into the measuring jug and cover with cling film.

4. Microwave the butter for 40-60 seconds (depending on the microwave power & amount of butter).

5. Remove the cling film from the measuring jug and add the flour to the melted butter.

6. Stir the flour into the butter to make a smooth paste.  
(This is called a Roux)

7. Slowly, bit by bit, add the milk to the Roux and whisk it to create a sauce.  
(Once heated and thickened, this is called a Béchamel sauce)

8. Cover the jug again in cling film and microwave for 3 minutes on full power.  
(If you're making a larger/smaller batch of Macaroni cheese, then you'll need to adjust this time appropriately.  
For instance: If you're using 1.5 pints of milk, then microwave it for 4.5 minutes; or if you're using half a pint of milk, then microwave it for 1.5 minutes)

9. Whisk well until it's nice and smooth and fully mixed.

10. Cover and microwave again for a further 2.5 minutes (again, adjust time accordingly).

11. Whisk well again.

12. If it's not thick enough to "hold" the macaroni then microwave it in bursts of max 30 seconds and whisk after each time.  
However, _watch it like a hawk_ or it could boil over (which you don't want).

13. Turn your grill onto a medium/high heat.

14. Add salt and pepper and a handful of grated cheese to the Béchamel sauce and whisk.  
(Add more or less cheese to taste but _**do not reheat after you've added the cheese**_ or it goes oily.

15. Whisk well and let the cheese melt in the heat of the sauce.  
(Adding cheese to a Béchamel sauce turns it into a Mornay sauce)

16. Add the macaroni to the serving dish.

17. Pour the Mornay sauce over the macaroni. Use the spoontula to scrap any of the Mornay sauce that is stuck to the measuring jug, into the serving dish.

18. Using the spoontula, mix the macaroni into the Mornay sauce until it's evenly distributed and then make sure the top is even

19. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs evenly over the top in an even layer.

20. Sprinkle the remaining grated cheese over the breadcrumbs.
 
21. Place the dish on a shelf or grill pan and put under the grill so that the top of the dish is around 2-3 inches away from the grill element.

22. Grill until the cheese is browned and bubbling. Use oven gloves to take it out.

23. Serve straight away.

## Alternative Method to make Mornay Sauce

### Extra Equipment Needed

- Another large saucepan  
(if you're using a metal whisk, make sure it's _not_ a non-stick pan)

### Method

1. Melt the butter in the saucepan over a medium heat.

2. Take the saucepan off the heat and add the flour and whisk to form a Roux.

3. On a low heat, cook for 1 minute. _But do not brown._

4. Take the saucepan off the heat and gradually whisk in the milk, a little at a time.

5. Cook for approximately 10 minutes, until you've made a thick, smooth (Béchamel) sauce.

6. Take the saucepan off the heat and add salt & pepper and a handful of cheese (add more or less cheese, to taste).

7. Still off the heat, whisk and let the cheese melt in the sauce, at which point: you've made a smooth Mornay sauce.
