This will serve 2 people and takes around 20 minutes to make.

## Equipment

- Roasting Tray

- Foil (optional)

- Chopping board

## Ingredients

- 2 Cod Fillets

- Mushrooms  
  (I'm using small chestnut mushrooms as I like the taste of them)

- Broccoli

- Oil
  I'm using vegetable oil as it's cheap and has a high smoking point, meaning that it's better for high temperature cooking (something we're going to do) than an oil with a low smoking point, like olive oil (though I do prefer the taste of olive oil).

- Lemon Juice (optional)

- Some Herbs and Spices  
  For this, I used:
  - Salt
  - Pepper
  - Ginger
  - Rosemary
  - Oregano

## Method

1. Pre-heat the oven to 200°C (180°C Fan). Whilst it's preheating, continue with the following steps:
   
2. Wipe the mushrooms with a damp piece of kitchen towel or clean cloth to get the grime off the mushrooms.

3. On your chopping board, cut your broccoli into florets (small heads of broccoli) and wash it in a colander to get any bits of dirt, bugs or general gunk off the broccoli.

4. Cover the inside of your roasting tray in foil, this is going to make the roasting tray easier to clean after you've used it. This is completely optional.

5. Place the mushrooms and broccoli inside the tray. Leaving space for the cod fillets 

6. Take your cod fillets and place into the space you've left on the tray.

7. Now drizzle a little oil over all the vegetables. This will make them crisp up nicely in the oven (no need to put any on the cod as fish is quite oily itself).

8. Time to season! I encourage you to experiment here, but as some guidance, I'll tell you what I did:
    1. Salt & Pepper on everything.
    2. A little ginger on the cod as cod is quite a bland fish and I wanted to give it a bit of a tangy flavour.
    3. Rosemary on the vegetables to give them a nice floral smell and taste.
    4. Oregano on everything. Oregano has a lovely earthy, green smell and is great for giving a little depth to a simple dish.

9. I didn't do this when I cooked, but in hindsight, the fish had depth and flavour, but needed more top notes/sharpness to it to really make it pop.  
   As such, I recommend adding a drizzle of lemon juice to the cod.

10. Once your oven has come up to temperature, bung the roasting tray in the oven and leave it for about 10 minutes.

11. Serve and enjoy! I recommend serving with chilled, white wine; a citrus-y beer or any citrus-y soft drink. This is going to bring out those top notes again as the entire dish is quite focused on mid and bottom odours, so the high notes in white wine and citrus-y drinks are going to help balance it out.
