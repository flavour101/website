This will serve 4-5 people, but will vary on the size of your beef joint.

It takes around 2 hours to make.

## Equipment

- Roasting Tray

- Pestle & Mortar

- Chopping board

## Ingredients

- 1x 1.4kg Topside Beef Joint

- Black Pepper

- Cumin

- Smoked Paprika

- Mustard seeds

- Salt

- Any other spices you want!

## Method

1. Pre-heat the oven to 210°C (190°C Fan).

2. Grab your Pestle & Mortar and make a dry rub from the spices.  
   Taste the rub as you mix it together to ensure it's as spicy/balanced as you want it to be (equal parts of each it probably a safe bet).  
   Aim to have about a handful once you're done.

   (If you don't have a Pestle & Mortar, you can buy powdered/ground spices and then mix them together in a bowl.)


3. Take out your beef joint (remove it from any packaging, though if it comes in a string net then leave that on!).

4. Sprinkle the dry rub onto your chopping board and spread it around a little.
   
5. Gently roll/move the beef joint in the dry rub ensuring that you cover the entire beef joint.

6. Place your beef joint in a roasting try (if you're watching your weight, put a metal rack in the roasting tray so the fat juices can drain away from the meat).

7. Bung it in the oven for an hour and a half (90 minutes).  
   (Traditionally you want to give beef joints 25 minutes per 500g + an extra 25 minutes. I like beef a little leaner than plain brown and taking it out a touch early ensures I won't over-cook it, where it will become quite tough and chewy).

8. Best served with some roast vegetables, enjoy it whilst it's hot. However, if you have some left over, leave it to cool then wrap it up in kitchen foil and put it in the fridge and have it in a sandwich or use it in a curry!
