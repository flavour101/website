# Hello!

I’m Matt Smith, a.k.a. Harmelodic, and welcome to Flavour 101.

This site is dedicated to the pursuit of improving people's food experiences on a fundamental level.  
Whether it's my own personal opinions in a _**Review**_ of a restaurant; some advice, guidance and general talk about food in a _**Blog**_ post; or a _**Recipe**_ of a dish that I've enjoyed cooking and feel should be shared with a wider audience.

There's also a _**Gallery**_ of all the photos that I take to accompany the above written pieces, so if you want to look at pictures of good food and pretty restaurants, you can head on over to there to get your fix.

## Backstory

When I grew up in the rural backcountry of North Yorkshire, my mother cooked for our family. My brother's and I would wolf down robust, healthy, delicious meals full of colour, flavour and good company. Fish, pork, beef, lamb, vegetables, pies, pasta, pizzas, curries; My mother would cook it all and the 5 of us in our house would feast and take delight in filling our bellies.

My brothers grew up and actually entered into the food and drink industry, with Rob becoming an excellent chef travelling the world and polishing his skills, and Alex becoming a barman and drinks specialist who has also roamed the globe using his vast knowledge to strive for perfection.

For me, food has never really been a profession, but a passion. The entire experience of dining with friends and family has brought joy and warmth to my life.
As I grew older, I found that although I enjoyed eating, I wasn’t an especially good cook. At 18, I sat with my mother to get some advice on cooking so that I wouldn’t have to rely on anyone else's cooking when I left home. A year later, I left to live and work in Manchester with a small book containing my favourite recipes of my mother’s and the basic skills on how to ensure I didn’t starve.  
The past few years have been sensational as I’ve learnt how to cook better, experimented with different ingredients, and experienced different delicacies in foreign countries.

Unfortunately, some of what I’ve learnt has disappointed me.

The western world has fetishised the food industry. Fast-food chains are everywhere, cases of obesity have dramatically risen and websites have garnered millions of views showing pictures and videos of overly colourful, unhealthy food. Not only this, but famous chefs and TV shows have propagated the idea that good food, although is easy to make, needs to contain exotic, expensive ingredients or be presented with an elegance that seems impossible to anyone other than a professional chef.

Paired with this fetishism, is the spread of ignorance. You can find recipes in books and on the internet, but very few places actually tell you WHY something is done or WHY an ingredient is used. Anyone can find a recipe for nearly anything, but ask someone to experiment with a dish and few people would be open to doing so.

In 2015, I travelled to Copenhagen to visit my brother Alex. There I found a culture ripe with people who are passionate about their hobbies and their work and I had many conversations with Alex and his Danish friends surrounding food, drink and the meaningfulness of good life experiences.  
It felt, once more, like I was home again at my mother’s table.

Building on my love of cooking, personal experiences and passion for spreading knowledge, I wanted to start a project to share with world on the fundamentals of cooking and truly experiencing food in the best way possible.

This is Flavour 101.
