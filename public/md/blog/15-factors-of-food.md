Most people, at least that I’ve met, are able to do rudimentary cooking.

Oven-baked pizza? Simple pasta dishes? Maybe a fried egg sandwich?
That’s all great, but it’s very carb-heavy and if you ask someone to go and experiment with spices or something that isn’t covered in cheese, I’m willing to bet that most people are going to back away.

Like with all things, learning how to cook is a gradual process of trying, making mistakes and learning from them; But where do you begin?

I am a firm believer in that if you want to learn how to cook, you need to learn how to taste. There are countless movies and TV shows that picture pretentious characters talking about characteristics of food, and we can take a lesson from them.

To make it easy, I've spent a lot of time deconstructing the idea of _experiencing food_ into 15 factors.  
Once you've finished reading this blog, you'll be able to enjoy experiencing food with a new point of view that I hope you will take forward in your future cooking:

## Saltiness

Saltiness is one of the five basic tastes that the human tongue can detect. Quite simply, this is how salty the food is.  
Things like oysters, bread and...well salt, are very salty.

## Sweetness

Another one of the five basic tastes, sweetness is how sweet or sugary a food is.  
Chocolate, cake, fizzy drinks are packed with sugar (you'd be surprised how much sugar is in everything!) and as a result are very sweet.

## Sourness

Sourness, another basic taste, measures how sour food is.  
This can be particularly prevelant in some sweets, vinegar and acidic & citrusy foods.

## Bitterness

Still with the basic tastes, bitterness measures how bitter something is.  
Bitterness is often associated with beer, dark chocolate, ginger,  and other "earthy", acrid foods.

## Umami

Umami, the popularly used Japanese term for "savouriness", and one of the five basic tastes, is how savoury a food is.  
Cooked meat, soy sauce, tomatoes and broths have strong Umami components.

## Pungency

Pungency, usually referred to as _spiciness_, is how spicy or "hot" a food is.  
Spiciness tends to come from a chemical called "Capsaicin" which is found a lot in (you guessed it) chili peppers.

## Odour - Top

Top odours, or "top notes", are the actual _flavours_ that you can detect (and usually smell) from a food that tend to be sharp, "bright", sour and sweet.  
Flavours like lemon, orange, white wine, and light desserts usually have strong top notes.

## Odour - Mid

Mid odours, or "mid notes", are the _flavours_ that you can detect in the middle of your palette.  
These are the more salty and umami-filled flavours like tomato, bread, pasta, meat.

## Odour - Bottom

Bottom odours/notes are the bitter, "deep", rich flavours that you can taste.  
Often found in rich, heavy desserts and earthy meals, bottom notes give a depth and "round" flavour to a dish.

## Sound

When you crunch into a taco, or slurp up some hot noodles, those _sounds_ amplify your encounters of those foods. Not all dishes will have or should have strong or loud sounds, but sound is definitely a contributing factor into your experience.

## Mouthfeel

A term I've taken from [the hilarious Charles Boyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqI7k6AA7LA) but I've made it a little more vague than his term.  
Mouthfeel basically describes texture. How soft is a piece of cheese? How crunchy is that nacho? But more than that, how does your mouth _feel_ when you're eating it? Does it coat your mouth in a filmy texture like wine? Does it scratch your cheeks like crisps do?

## Aftertaste

After you swallow your food, you'll often notice flavours at the back of your tongue and residual flavours left on the tongue. This is Aftertaste and describes the flavours and sensations you experience after consuming food.

## Colour

Colour is colour and food covers the entire spectrum, from red meat to green peppers, from yellow lemons to black beans. Is your dish looking particularly dark-brown? Consider adding more greens with some garnishes and vegetables or white and yellow cheese to brighten things up. Colourful food looks better and leads to a more satisfactory, fulfilling meal.

## Presentation



## Psychological effect



And that's all 15!

Now it's your task to take this knowledge and apply it! I encourage you to start searching for these factors in your food experiences. Whether it's when you're out for a dinner, drinking cocktails in a bar, or munching on a pizza at home with Netflix.

All it takes are a few moments to think about what you're eating, what factors you can discover and you'll be well on your way to become a food connoisseur! (How pretentious you want to be, is up to you.)

From there, all you have to do is take what you've learnt and start applying it to your cooking. Does something taste very bitter and savoury? Then it's probably full of bottom and mid-notes; Try adding some more top-notes (e.g. lemon) to balance it out!
