So, you want to start cooking!

But what do you need?  
Probably a saucepan or two, a frying pan, and a few spoons.

But which ones to get? What makes a good frying pan? Is there anything that you've forgotten (or simply never happened upon) that would be useful?

In this blog, I'm going to take you through what I believe are the _essential_ kitchen utensils, that you need to get cooking.

## Pots & Pans

### Frying Pan

One of the most versatile piece of equipment in your kitchen. You need to fry some bacon and eggs? Sautéing some vegetables? Searing a cut of fish? You can get so much out of a frying pan.

When buying, look for medium-sized one with a solid, thick base (not thin or flimsy) so it conducts heat better. Non-stick is _highly_ recommended but still optional, and if you really want to cook like a pro: Get an oven-proof one with a metal handle, so you can finish cooking things in the oven or under a grill.

### Saucepans

Fundamentally, you need 2 saucepans: A medium-sized one, with a single stick handle; and a large one with 2 handles. Lids are a must, so that you can steam ingredients and put over warming water to boil it quicker.

The medium-sized pan will be used for cooking rice, making sauces and generally smaller dishes.

The large one is for stews, pasta or when you need to cook a lot of something.

Like with a frying pan, a good saucepan has a heavy, thick base. You can get them in a variety of metals (stainless steel, copper) but I recommend stainless steel ones with a non-stick inside and a glass lid, so you can see inside the pan whilst the lid is on.

### Casserole Dish (recommended)

Casserole Dishes are fantastic for...well making casserole, as well as stews and other one-pot delights.

A heavy duty, cast iron casserole dish with a lid will be your friend for life, if you take care of it. You can cook with it on the hob, or in the oven and it retains it heat so well that you can turn the heat down to lowest setting and your casserole and stews will cook slowly and beautifully.

## Utensils

### Chef's knife

The chef's knife (often referred to as a chopping knife, or cook's knife) is one of the most important pieces of kit in your kitchen. Used for chopping, dicing, crushing (with the side of the blade) and pretty much anything else you want to do, the chef's knife will be the most used knife in your kitchen.

You want one with a 15-18cm (6-7") blade with a nice heavy handle that you can grip well. A great chef's knife is one that the chef likes holding and has control over.

My brother, a professional chef, once told me:

> When you're buying a knife, take a look at the big sets of knives, and think about how much money you'd spend on one of those sets.  
> When you've decided on that: Take all that money and buy a _single_ chef's knife.  

If a professional chef can say that, I hope you understand how important it is to get a good chef's knife.

### Paring knife

Often just referred to as a "small" knife, a paring knife is used for slicing up fruit and vegetables as well as generally performing the finer work that a smaller knife can do better.

Same as the chef's knife, a good paring knife has some weight to it and is one that you can pick up and feel in control when using it.

### Serated knife

Usually just called a "bread" knife, a serated knife is used for slicing large tough ingredients and dishes (usually bread, hence the name) but can also be used for carving, when you don't own a special carving knife.

Like with the other knives, a good serated knife is weighty, long and reasonably inflexible.

### Grater

A grater is used for...well, grating! Whether it's cheese, bread (to make breadcrumbs) or vegetables, a grater is a great (forgive the pun) tool to have in your kitchen.

Try to get a "box" grater with a solid handle, so you can hold it firm and steady. The box grater gives you 4 different coarse plates that can be used for zesting, grating and slicing.  
However, if you're a student and not going to be doing any fancy grating, then get a simple grater with a container as it's _much_ easier to clean than a box grater.

### Speed peeler

Speed peelers are amazing. They let you peel vegetables incredibly quickly, whilst creating minimal waste and are super easy to wash. Be careful though! They're sharp!

Get one a nice solid feeling stainless steel one, as the cheap ones with plastic handles can fall apart and get rusty.

### Spoontula

Sometimes referred to on websites as a silicon spoon, a spoontula is one of the most versatile utensils around.  
Half way between a spoon and a spatula, it gives you something to stir sauces, scramble eggs, turn omelettes & pancakes, mix baking ingredients in a bowl, and scrape every last morsel of food from a pan or mixing bowl.

My favourite ones have been trapezium shaped ones with a wooden handle, like [this one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00E7SIMQU/).

## Tools

### Sieve

Want to drain some rice? Wash some grapes? Sift some flour? Get a sieve.

They're usually pretty cheap and I actually recommend getting a plastic one. Metal ones are obviously better for the environment than plastic, but cheap metal sieves tend to rust and you don't want rusty rice.

### Chopping Board

Protecting your worktop and giving you something to move piles of chopped ingredients around the kitchen, the chopping board is a staple of the kitchen.

Heavy, thick wooden boards are fantastic (and more environmentally-friendly than plastic). Try to get one without any ridges cut into the board as this captures water and food crumbs, which can be great for keeping food on the board, but a nightmare for properly cleaning and reducing the build up of bacteria.

Final note on wooden chopping boards: Always handwash them as the dishwasher can damage and bend the wood, and rub them in oil occasionally to protect the wood to really make it last a long time.

### Scales

Following a recipe? Baking a cake where you want to get the weight of the ingredients just right? You need a pair of scales.

Electric scales are the best as they're easier to calibrate and can be much more precise and accurate than mechanical scales. Plus, you can switch units at the touch of a button!

### Pestle & Mortar

Contrary to my belief that the Pestle & Mortar was a very pretentious, upper-middle class kitchen implement, [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/Harmelodic) followers has informed me that it's actually quite a simple, useful thing. Since buying one, I agree wholeheartedly.  
It can be used for grinding up herbs and spices, making rubs for roast meats, making your own pestos, and more!

Get a large, thick, heavy, stone pestle & mortar that has a large circumference to maximise how much you can move the pestle around inside the mortar.

## Baking & Roasting

### Roasting Tray

Roasting meat, vegetables or anything that is going to produce a lot of juices when roasting, is an easy way to cook. Simply bung a bunch of ingredients in a roasting tray, drizzle with oil, herbs and spices and throw it in the oven for a while.

You want to get heavy duty roasting tray so that it doesn't buckle when in the oven and so it lasts.  
Handles are a great feature for ease of use but make sure that they're well-fitted and don't feel flimsy as they can snap off if cheaply fitted.

### Baking Tray

Great for putting pizzas on as well as baking bread and cookies.

Like with the roasting tray, you want to get a heavy duty one to prevent it buckling and to maximise durability.

### Baking Tins

Everyone loves baking when you're a kid. Whether it's making cupcakes, delicious chocolate cakes or a good banana bread. Baking tins are handy to have around if you need to whip up a birthday cake or you want to do some baking in some free time.

Like with the trays, you want to get heavy duty, thick tins to ensure they last a long time and don't buckle in the oven.
